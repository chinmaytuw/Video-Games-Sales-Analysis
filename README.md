## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I have used Kaggle Video Games Sales data for this project. The questions I am trying to answer are:

1. What is the most successful game across all platforms in terms of sales since 1980?
2. Who are the top publishers for the three highest selling genre?
3. How have different platforms fared across the years in terms of total sales?
